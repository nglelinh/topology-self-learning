    Lecture 01.02: Closed Sets, Closure, and Interior
    
  </h1>
  <p><strong>Closed Sets, Closure, and Interior</strong></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="-tổng-quan">📖 Tổng quan</h2>

<p>Trong hai bài trước, chúng ta tập trung vào <strong>open sets</strong>—khái niệm primitive của topology. Nhưng toán học thường có tính <strong>duality</strong> (đối ngẫu): với mỗi khái niệm, có một “dual concept” equally important.</p>

<p><strong>Open sets</strong> have natural dual: <strong>closed sets</strong>. From this duality emerge powerful <strong>operators</strong> transforming sets: <strong>Interior (int)</strong> captures “completely inside” part, <strong>Closure (cl)</strong> adds “boundary” to set, và <strong>Boundary (∂)</strong> marks “border” between inside and outside.</p>

<p>These operators are <strong>most important tools</strong> trong entire topology! They appear everywhere. <strong>Density</strong> gets defined via closure: A dense exactly when cl(A) = X, meaning A’s closure fills entire space. <strong>Continuity</strong> has elegant characterization: f continuous if and only if preimages of closed sets are closed. <strong>Point classification</strong> (interior points, boundary points, limit points) relies completely on these operators, providing vocabulary for discussing “position” in abstract spaces.</p>

<p><strong>Trong bài này</strong> we systematically develop dual theory. <strong>Closed sets</strong> với their axioms mirror open set axioms beautifully. <strong>Closure operator</strong> cl(·) emerges with rich properties and geometric intuition—it “completes” a set by adding limit points. <strong>Interior operator</strong> int(·) reveals itself as perfect dual của closure, stripping away boundary. <strong>Boundary</strong> ∂ precisely captures “border” between inside và outside. <strong>Limit points</strong> versus <strong>isolated points</strong> dichotomy classifies how points relate to their sets. <strong>Dense sets</strong> concept (like ℚ trong ℝ) captures “everywhere presence” through closure.</p>

<p><strong>Tại sao absolutely essential?</strong> Closure and interior provide language for <strong>approximation</strong>—fundamental idea threading through analysis and topology. <strong>Limit points</strong> form foundation for convergence theory, enabling us to discuss “approaching” without explicit sequences. <strong>Dense sets</strong> are key (ℚ dense trong ℝ means rationals approximate any real), appearing trong separability, Baire category theorem, và Stone-Weierstrass. These operators <strong>define</strong> many topological properties: regularity, normality, separability all formulated using closure and interior.</p>

<h2 id="-từ-trực-giác-đến-hình-thức">🎯 Từ Trực giác đến Hình thức</h2>

<h3 id="câu-chuyện-về-ranh-giới">Câu chuyện về Ranh giới</h3>

<p>Hãy tưởng tượng một <strong>vùng đất</strong> trên bản đồ. Vùng này có:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Interior</strong> (phần trong): Tất cả điểm “hoàn toàn bên trong”—đi một chút mọi hướng vẫn ở trong vùng</li>
  <li><strong>Boundary</strong> (biên giới): Đường viền—một bước ra ngoài, một bước vào trong</li>
  <li><strong>Exterior</strong> (phần ngoài): Tất cả điểm hoàn toàn bên ngoài</li>
  <li><strong>Closure</strong> (bao đóng): Interior + Boundary = “vùng đất cộng với biên”</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Interior_Boundary_Exterior.svg/500px-Interior_Boundary_Exterior.svg.png" alt="Interior, Boundary, Exterior" /><br />
<em>Interior (xanh), Boundary (đỏ), Exterior (trắng) - Nguồn: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Interior_Boundary_Exterior.svg">Wikimedia Commons</a></em></p>

<p><strong>Ví dụ cụ thể trong ℝ:</strong></p>

<p>Xét A = [0, 1) (nửa khoảng)</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Interior:</strong> int(A) = (0, 1)<br />
<em>Lý do:</em> Mọi điểm trong (0, 1) có một khoảng nhỏ xung quanh vẫn trong A.<br />
Nhưng 0 không (mọi khoảng chứa 0 đều có điểm âm ∉ A).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Boundary:</strong> ∂A = {0, 1}<br />
<em>Lý do:</em> 0 và 1 là “điểm biên”—mọi neighborhood chứa cả điểm trong và ngoài A.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Closure:</strong> cl(A) = [0, 1]<br />
<em>Lý do:</em> Thêm điểm biên 1 vào A.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Observation quan trọng:</strong> Notice beautiful inclusion chain: int(A) ⊆ A ⊆ cl(A). Interior is “largest open set inside A”, A itself sits in middle, và closure is “smallest closed set containing A”.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A open ⟺ A = int(A)</li>
  <li>A closed ⟺ A = cl(A)</li>
  <li>∂A = cl(A) \ int(A)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="-định-nghĩa-hình-thức">📐 Định nghĩa Hình thức</h2>

<h3 id="1-closed-sets-tập-đóng">1. Closed Sets (Tập Đóng)</h3>

<p><strong>Định nghĩa (Closed Set):</strong><br />
Trong topological space (X, 𝜏), tập F ⊆ X là <strong>closed</strong> nếu complement của nó open:</p>

\[F \text{ closed} \iff X \setminus F \in \tau\]

<p><strong>Ví dụ trong ℝ (Euclidean topology):</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>[a, b]</strong> closed (complement = (-∞,a) ∪ (b,∞) open)</li>
  <li><strong>{x}</strong> (singleton) closed (complement = ℝ \ {x} open)</li>
  <li><strong>ℕ</strong> closed</li>
  <li><strong>Cantor set</strong> closed</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Dual Axioms for Closed Sets:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Định lý:</strong> Họ tất cả closed sets thỏa mãn:</p>

<p><strong>(C1)</strong> ∅ và X closed</p>

<p><strong>(C2)</strong> <strong>Giao tùy ý</strong> closed sets là closed:
\(\{F_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in I} \text{ closed} \implies \bigcap_{\alpha \in I} F_\alpha \text{ closed}\)</p>

<p><strong>(C3)</strong> <strong>Hợp hữu hạn</strong> closed sets là closed:
\(F_1, \ldots, F_n \text{ closed} \implies F_1 \cup \cdots \cup F_n \text{ closed}\)</p>

<p><strong>Chứng minh:</strong> Dùng De Morgan’s laws:</p>
<ul>
  <li>X \ (⋂Fα) = ⋃(X \ Fα) ∈ 𝜏 (arbitrary unions of open sets)</li>
  <li>X \ (F₁ ∪ … ∪ Fₙ) = (X\F₁) ∩ … ∩ (X\Fₙ) ∈ 𝜏 (finite intersections) ∎</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Comparison với Open Sets:</strong></p>

      <th>Open Sets</th>
      <th>Closed Sets</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>∅, X open</td>
      <td>∅, X closed</td>
    </tr>

    </tr>
    <tr>

<p><strong>Chú ý quan trọng:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>“Not open” ≠ “closed”</li>
  <li>“Not closed” ≠ “open”</li>
  <li>Một tập có thể vừa open vừa closed: <strong>clopen</strong></li>
  <li>Một tập có thể không open không closed: ví dụ [0,1) trong ℝ</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-closure-operator-toán-tử-bao-đóng">2. Closure Operator (Toán tử Bao đóng)</h3>

<p><strong>Định nghĩa (Closure):</strong><br />
Cho A ⊆ X. <strong>Closure</strong> của A là giao của tất cả closed sets chứa A:</p>

\[\overline{A} = \text{cl}(A) = \bigcap \{F : F \text{ closed}, A \subseteq F\}\]

<p><strong>Trực giác:</strong> cl(A) là <strong>smallest closed set</strong> containing A.</p>

<p><strong>Ví dụ trong ℝ:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>cl((0,1)) = [0,1]</li>
  <li>cl([0,1]) = [0,1] (đã closed)</li>
  <li>cl(ℚ) = ℝ (vì ℚ dense)</li>
  <li>cl({1/n : n ∈ ℕ}) = {1/n} ∪ {0}</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Định lý (Properties of Closure):</strong></p>

<p>Closure operator thỏa mãn bốn <strong>Kuratowski closure axioms</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>(K1) Extensivity:</strong> 
\(A \subseteq \overline{A}\)</p>

<p><strong>(K2) Idempotence:</strong>
\(\overline{\overline{A}} = \overline{A}\)</p>

<p><strong>(K3) Preservation of unions:</strong>
\(\overline{A \cup B} = \overline{A} \cup \overline{B}\)</p>

<p><strong>(K4) Normality:</strong>
\(\overline{\emptyset} = \emptyset\)</p>

<p><strong>Chứng minh:</strong></p>

<p><strong>(K1):</strong> cl(A) là closed set chứa A, nên A ⊆ cl(A) ✓</p>

<p><strong>(K2):</strong> cl(A) closed, nên cl(cl(A)) = cl(A) ✓</p>

<p><strong>(K3):</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>cl(A) ∪ cl(B) closed (finite union of closed sets)</li>
  <li>A ∪ B ⊆ cl(A) ∪ cl(B)</li>
  <li>cl(A ∪ B) ⊆ cl(A) ∪ cl(B) (minimality)</li>
  <li>Ngược lại: A ⊆ A ∪ B ⇒ cl(A) ⊆ cl(A ∪ B), tương tự cl(B) ⊆ cl(A ∪ B)</li>
  <li>⇒ cl(A) ∪ cl(B) ⊆ cl(A ∪ B) ✓</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>(K4):</strong> Trivial: ∅ closed, nên cl(∅) = ∅ ✓</p>

<p><strong>Fact kỳ diệu (Kuratowski):</strong><br />
Có thể <strong>định nghĩa topology</strong> bằng một operator cl: 𝒫(X) → 𝒫(X) thỏa mãn (K1)–(K4)!</p>

<p>Sau đó: F closed ⟺ F = cl(F).</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="3-limit-points-điểm-tụ">3. Limit Points (Điểm Tụ)</h3>

<p><strong>Định nghĩa (Limit Point):</strong><br />
Điểm x ∈ X là <strong>limit point</strong> (accumulation point) của A ⊆ X nếu:</p>

\[\forall U \in \tau, x \in U: (U \cap A) \setminus \{x\} \neq \emptyset\]

<p><strong>Nói bằng lời:</strong> Mọi neighborhood của x chứa ít nhất một điểm của A <strong>khác x</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Trực giác:</strong> x là “điểm tụ” của A = điểm có các điểm của A “tụ lại gần” nó.</p>

<p><strong>Ví dụ trong ℝ:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>A = (0, 1)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Mọi x ∈ [0, 1] là limit points của A</li>
      <li>Ví dụ: 0 là limit point (vì mọi (0-ε, 0+ε) chứa điểm của (0,1))</li>
      <li>Điểm ngoài [0,1] không phải limit points</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>A = {1/n : n ∈ ℕ}</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>0 là limit point (unique!)</li>
      <li>Mọi 1/n <strong>không phải</strong> limit points (có neighborhood chỉ chứa chính nó)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Limit_point_illustration.svg/400px-Limit_point_illustration.svg.png" alt="Limit points visualization" /><br />
<em>Limit points của một tập - Nguồn concept</em></p>

<p><strong>Định nghĩa (Isolated Point):</strong><br />
Điểm x ∈ A là <strong>isolated point</strong> nếu nó <strong>không phải</strong> limit point của A.</p>

<p>Tương đương: ∃ neighborhood U của x sao cho U ∩ A = {x}.</p>

<p><strong>Ví dụ:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Trong A = {1/n : n ∈ ℕ}, mỗi 1/n là isolated</li>
  <li>Trong A = (0,1), không có isolated points</li>
  <li>Trong A = {0} ∪ (1,2), điểm 0 isolated</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Ký hiệu:</strong> A’ = tập tất cả limit points của A (derived set)</p>

<p><strong>Định lý (Closure via Limit Points):</strong>
\(\overline{A} = A \cup A'\)</p>

<p><strong>Trực giác:</strong> Closure = điểm gốc + điểm tụ.</p>

<p><strong>Chứng minh (sketch):</strong></p>

<p><strong>(⊆):</strong> Cho x ∈ cl(A). Nếu x ∉ A, cần chứng minh x ∈ A’.<br />
Giả sử (phản chứng) x không phải limit point.<br />
Tồn tại U ∋ x với U ∩ A = ∅ hoặc {x}.<br />
Nếu U ∩ A = ∅: A ⊆ X \ U (closed), nên cl(A) ⊆ X \ U ⇒ x ∉ cl(A), mâu thuẫn.</p>

<p><strong>(⊇):</strong> A ⊆ cl(A) rõ ràng. Cần A’ ⊆ cl(A).<br />
Cho x ∈ A’. Mọi closed F ⊇ A phải chứa x (vì nếu x ∉ F, thì U = X \ F là neighborhood của x với U ∩ A = ∅, mâu thuẫn với x ∈ A’). ∎</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="4-interior-operator-toán-tử-phần-trong">4. Interior Operator (Toán tử Phần trong)</h3>

<p><strong>Định nghĩa (Interior):</strong><br />
<strong>Interior</strong> của A là hợp của tất cả open sets chứa trong A:</p>

\[A° = \text{int}(A) = \bigcup \{U \in \tau : U \subseteq A\}\]

<p><strong>Trực giác:</strong> int(A) là <strong>largest open set</strong> contained in A.</p>

<h3 id="5-boundary-biên">5. Boundary (Biên)</h3>

<p><strong>Định nghĩa (Boundary):</strong><br />
<strong>Boundary</strong> (frontier) của A là:</p>

\[\partial A = \overline{A} \setminus \text{int}(A)\]

<p><strong>Phát biểu tương đương:</strong>
\(\partial A = \overline{A} \cap \overline{X \setminus A}\)</p>

<p><strong>Trực giác:</strong> Điểm x ∈ ∂A nếu:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Mọi neighborhood của x chứa cả điểm trong A và điểm ngoài A</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Ví dụ trong ℝ:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>∂([0,1]) = {0, 1}</li>
  <li>∂((0,1)) = {0, 1}</li>
  <li>∂(ℚ) = ℝ (mọi số thực là boundary!)</li>
  <li>∂(∅) = ∅</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tính chất:</strong></p>

<h3 id="6-dense-sets-tập-trù-mật">6. Dense Sets (Tập Trù mật)</h3>

<p><strong>Định nghĩa (Dense):</strong><br />
Tập A ⊆ X là <strong>dense</strong> trong X nếu:</p>

\[\overline{A} = X\]

<p><strong>Phát biểu tương đương:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Mọi non-empty open set giao với A</li>
  <li>Mọi điểm x ∈ X là limit point của A hoặc thuộc A</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Ví dụ:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>ℚ dense trong ℝ:</strong> Mọi khoảng mở chứa số hữu tỉ</li>
  <li><strong>ℝ \ ℚ (irrational) dense trong ℝ:</strong> Mọi khoảng mở chứa số vô tỉ</li>
  <li><strong>(0,1) dense trong [0,1]:</strong> cl((0,1)) = [0,1]</li>
  <li><strong>{0,1} không dense trong ℝ:</strong> cl({0,1}) = {0,1} ≠ ℝ</li>

<em>ℚ dense trong ℝ - Nguồn concept</em></p>

<p><strong>Định nghĩa (Nowhere Dense):</strong><br />
A là <strong>nowhere dense</strong> nếu int(cl(A)) = ∅.</p>

<p><strong>Trực giác:</strong> A “thin” đến mức closure của nó cũng không chứa open set nào.</p>

<p><strong>Ví dụ:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>ℕ nowhere dense trong ℝ:</strong> int(cl(ℕ)) = int(ℕ) = ∅</li>
  <li><strong>Cantor set nowhere dense:</strong> int(Cantor) = ∅</li>
  <li><strong>{1/n : n ∈ ℕ} nowhere dense</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Ứng dụng quan trọng:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Định lý Baire (Preview):</strong><br />
Trong complete metric space, hợp countable các nowhere dense sets có interior rỗng.</p>

<p><strong>Hệ quả:</strong> ℝ không thể viết như hợp countable các nowhere dense sets.<br />
→ ℝ “large” theo nghĩa topology!</p>

<p><strong>Định lý (Equivalent Definitions):</strong><br />
Các phát biểu sau <strong>tương đương</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>x ∈ cl(A)</li>
  <li>Mọi neighborhood của x giao với A</li>
  <li>Mọi open set chứa x giao với A</li>
  <li>x ∈ A hoặc x là limit point của A</li>

<p><strong>Chứng minh:</strong></p>

<p><strong>(1 ⇒ 2):</strong> Giả sử (phản chứng) ∃ neighborhood N của x với N ∩ A = ∅.<br />
Tồn tại U ∈ 𝜏 với x ∈ U ⊆ N.<br />
Khi đó X \ U closed, A ⊆ X \ U, nên cl(A) ⊆ X \ U.<br />
Nhưng x ∈ cl(A) và x ∈ U → mâu thuẫn!</p>

<p><strong>(2 ⇒ 3):</strong> Trivial (mọi open set chứa x là neighborhood).</p>

<p><strong>(3 ⇒ 4):</strong> Nếu x ∈ A, done. Nếu x ∉ A:<br />
Mọi U ∋ x có U ∩ A ≠ ∅.<br />
Vì x ∉ A, nên U ∩ A chứa điểm ≠ x.<br />
→ x là limit point.</p>

<p><strong>(4 ⇒ 1):</strong> cl(A) = A ∪ A’, nên x ∈ cl(A). ∎</p>

<h2 id="-summary">🎓 Summary</h2>

<p>Trong bài giảng này, chúng ta học về các <strong>operators</strong> quan trọng nhất:</p>

<p>✅ <strong>Closed Sets:</strong> Dual của open sets, axioms (C1)–(C3)<br />
✅ <strong>Closure cl(·):</strong> Smallest closed set containing A<br />
✅ <strong>Kuratowski Axioms:</strong> (K1) Extensivity, (K2) Idempotence, (K3) Unions, (K4) Normality<br />
✅ <strong>Limit Points:</strong> Điểm có các điểm của A “tụ lại gần”<br />
✅ <strong>Interior int(·):</strong> Largest open set in A, dual của closure<br />
✅ <strong>Boundary ∂:</strong> cl(A) \ int(A), “ranh giới”<br />
✅ <strong>Dense Sets:</strong> cl(A) = X, “everywhere” trong space</p>

<p><strong>Điểm chính:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Closure và interior là <strong>dual operators</strong>: int(A) = X \ cl(X \ A)</li>
  <li>Closure = original set + limit points: cl(A) = A ∪ A’</li>
  <li>Boundary = điểm mà mọi neighborhood intersects cả inside và outside</li>
  <li>Dense sets: ℚ và ℝ\ℚ đều dense trong ℝ</li>
  <li>Operators này satisfy nice axioms (Kuratowski, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Practical wisdom:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Để chứng minh A closed: chứng minh A = cl(A) hoặc complement open</li>
  <li>Để chứng minh x ∈ cl(A): chứng minh mọi neighborhood của x giao A</li>
  <li>Dense sets key trong approximation theory</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tiếp theo:</strong> Trong Lecture 01.03, chúng ta học về <strong>Continuous Functions và Homeomorphisms</strong>—cách ánh xạ giữa các topological spaces, và định nghĩa “topological equivalence”.</p>

<hr />

<p><em>“Closure is the smallest closed set; interior is the largest open set. Between them lies the boundary.”</em> — Topology wisdom</p>
